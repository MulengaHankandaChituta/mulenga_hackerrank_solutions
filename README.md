Welcome to the Mulenga HackerRank solutions repository
This repository contains solutions to the various Python challenges on HackerRank
organized by problem type.The goal is to practice problem solving, strengthen Python
fundamentals and demonstrate my coding skills in real world scenarios.

Problem Descriptions
1. Lists Problem

Simulates a list with dynamic operations (insert, append, remove, sort, reverse, pop).

Reads commands from user input and updates the list accordingly.

Goal: Practice list manipulation and command parsing in Python.

2. Runner-Up Score

Finds the second highest score from a list of integers.

Goal: Practice sorting, sets, and indexing techniques.

3. Nested Lists

Finds students with the second lowest score from a list of [name, score].

Goal: Practice nested lists, list comprehension, sorting, and handling edge cases.

4. Student Marks Average

Stores student marks in a dictionary and calculates the average for a queried student.

Goal: Practice dictionaries, list mapping, and formatted output.

Notes

All solutions are implemented in Python 3.

Interactive prompts are included for testing in IDLE.

Edge cases are handled carefully for reliability.

Takeaway

Solving these challenges strengthens problem-solving skills, improves Python fundamentals, and prepares me for real-world programming tasks, technical interviews.
